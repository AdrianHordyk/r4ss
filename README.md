### R code for Stock Synthesis

Stock Synthesis is a fisheries stock assessment model written in ADMB by Dr. Rick Methot at the [NOAA Northwest Fisheries Science Center](http://www.nwfsc.noaa.gov/). The R code in the r4ss package is based on the original work of Dr. Ian Stewart begun around 2005 and released as an R package on CRAN in 2009. The package has benefited from contributions, suggestions, and bug reports from many collaborators and users.
