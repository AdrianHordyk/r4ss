\title{Gather information for the NOAA Species Information System (SIS)}
\usage{
get_SIS_info(model, dir = NULL, writecsv = TRUE, stock = "StockName",
  final_year = 2019)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{Output from SS_output}

\item{dir}{Directory where the file will be written}

\item{writecsv}{Write results to a CSV file (where the name will have the
format "[species]_2019_SIS_info.csv" where \code{species}
is an additional input}

\item{final_year}{Year for reference points and final year of timeseries
(typically will be model$endyr + 1)}

\item{species}{String to prepend id info to filename for CSV file}
}
\description{
Processes model results contained in the list created by
\code{\link{SS_output}} in a format that is more convenient for submission
to SIS. Currently the results are returned invisibly as a list of two tables
and written to a CSV file from which results could be copied into SIS.
In the future some more direct link could be explored to avoid the manual
copy step.
