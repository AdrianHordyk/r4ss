r4ss is a package of tools related to the Stock Synthesis fisheries stock
assessment modeling framework. This first Vignette covers installing the
package and some basic uses.

## Installing the r4ss R package

The package can be run on OS X, Windows, or Linux.
The CRAN version of r4ss is not regularly updated and therefore likely out of
date. Instead it is recommended to install the from GitHub with the following
code:

```{r, install-and-load, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools") # if needed
devtools::install_github("r4ss/r4ss")

# If you would like the vignettes:
devtools::install_github("r4ss/r4ss", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

You can then load the package with:

```{r, load-package, eval=FALSE}
library("r4ss")
```

You can read the help files and access this vignette (and any others created
in the future) with:

```{r, help, eval=FALSE}
?r4ss
help(package = "r4ss")
browseVignettes("r4ss")
```

## Common uses of r4ss


The most important two functions are `SS_output` and `SS_plots`, the first
for reading the output from a Stock Synthesis model and the second for making
a large set of plots illustrating that output.

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
# it's useful to create a variable for the directory with the model output
mydir <- file.path(path.package("r4ss"), "extdata/simple_3.30")

# read the model output and print some diagnostic messages 
replist <- SS_output(dir = mydir, verbose=TRUE, printstats=TRUE)

# plots the results
SS_plots(replist)
```

By default `SS_plots` creates a large collection of PNG files in a new `plots` sub-directory in the same location as your model files, along with a set of HTML files (example excerpt below) to facilitate exploration of the figures in your browser. The home tab should open in your browser automatically after `SS_plots` completes making all the files.
